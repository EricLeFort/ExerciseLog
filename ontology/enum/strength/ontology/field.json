    "description": "Enumerates over the fields present in an ExerciseInfo.\n\nCOUNT_TYPE - The way to count this exercise. An isometric movement is measured in seconds, a compound lift in reps.\nEXERCISE_TYPE - The type of exercise. E.g. compound weight lifting, calisthenics, etc.\nIS_UNILATERAL - Whether the exercise uses a single limb at a time.\n  e.g. alternating bicep curls, single-leg leg curls\nIS_LIMB_INDEPENDENT - Whether the exercise works limbs independently.\n  e.g. cable flies are bilateral + limb independent\nREQUIRES_MACHINE - Whether a machine in required. Useful for knowing if an exercise can be compared across gyms.\nTENSILE_FOCUS - The type of muscle contraction happening during the primary portion of the lift.\nOPTIMAL_REP_RANGE - A bound of the ideal count for this exercise. They are just guiding values, not strict rules.\nMUSCLE_GROUPS_WORKED - A dict from the major muscle groups worked to a % activation of that muscle group.\n  e.g. biceps are involved in pec flies but their activation percentage is much lower than that of the pecs\nMUSCLES_WORKED - A dict from the muscles worked to a % activation of that muscle.\nANTAGONIST_MUSCLES - A set the antagonist muscles for the movement. Useful for root causing instability issues.",
